in this challenge, binary was sent in form of b64 encoded string through nc which was then written on our end

the binary called different functions depending on the input given from the prompt liek "choose from x or y or z..."

one of the functions called "cat flag" most of the times

one of the solutions used bruteforce by recursively calling different chains of options to eventually call the function which has cat flag in it.

```
def explore(path: list[bytes], explored: set[bytes]):
    print(path)

    with process(["./code.bin"]) as io:
        for item in path:
            io.sendline(item)
        io.recvlines(len(path))

        line = io.recvline(False, timeout=.2)
        if not line:
            # there's a sneaky function that call fgets()
            return
        if b"cat: /tmp/" in line:
            # got it :D
            return path

    options = line[7:-1].split(b" or ")

    for option in options:
        if option not in explored:
            explored.add(option)

            res = explore(path + [option], explored)
            if res:
                return res

get_binary(io)

path = explore([], set())
print(path)

payload = b"\n".join(path) + b"\n"
```
</details>
the binary is fuzzed locally and if it works then the payload is sent in the nc, this is done 50 more times.
